**PROJECT TITLE****MULTIPLE_YEAR_STOCK_DATA**

The project uploaded here is Excel data that has stocks for three years. The steps below were taken to visualise the data. A script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the ticker symbol, yearly change from the opening price at the beginning year to the closing price at the end of the year, percentage change, and the total stock volume. 

**Technology used**
- VBA
- Excel

**Steps taken**
1. Created a subroutine to perform the taste mentioned above
2. All the required variables, either as string, double or long data types, depending on the memory space required for each value or attribute.
3. Column headings as shown in the Excel sheet attached.
4. Initialise my Ticker to 2 and j to the start row.
5. Created a loop that runs through all the rows.
6. Calculate the yearly change and write it in J.
7. Performed conditional formatting for the per cent and yearly change columns.
8. Calculate the total volume and write it into the respective column.
9. Compare the greatest_increase, greatest_decrease and total volume to the respective next value.
10. Finally, I wrote summary results into the worksheet.

 **Challenges faced**
The main challenge was time, doing a crash program, and trying to catch up with classes, and projects simultaneously.
